(Title)Instead, Together We Can Distant Socialize

  For this project, I have developed a website using html5, css and javascript for the first time. This is an introduction website of a 2 minutes short film titled "Instead, Distant Socialize", which is a video about breaking the physical barrier and having fun with friends. Apart from introducing film to the users, this website is has a bigger cause; to encourage website users to stay connected, socialize safely and have some jolly moments with creativite methods, despite the current situation of having to do social distancing and staying at home for the most of our time.  
  
  As soon as I got an assignment to build a website, my first instinct was to design and add contents to the website by scripting codes directly on the software. However, during the class I was introduced with a process called wireframing, which is a process to establish the basic structure of a page before visual design and content is added. So I started with wireframing. I first brainstromed about the concept and the theme of the website based on its purpose, and I started to sketch out structures on the paper. I have used websites numerous times, but since there is no "one" format for the website and because I never developed website by myself before, I couldn't structure the film website on top of my head. So I visited multiple websites that introduces film. Each website was unique in their design, but the basic structure was that there is a navigation bar on top followed by contents, and there is a footer with contacts on the botoom. Following this basic structure, I sketched the structures on the paper, and digitalized the wireframe using Adobe XD. I structured my website with four pages in total; the main homepage, cast&crew page, reviews page and the interactive page where users get to learn how to edit a video like the film. Even though it seemed like an extra work in the beginning, taking time to brainstrom and wireframing the website in fact helped me a lot during the process of designing and scripting website because I had a visual reference to keep stay on track, and to make sure multiple pages are talking to one another and share certain design format that makes all of them to be a one website. 
 
  As visitors visit the webiste, I wanted to make sure the cause of this website is conveyed because i wanted viewers to take time to interpret and digest the message that i want to share before they actually get to see the film. Therefore, as visitors enter the main page of the webiste, on the screen, the first thing they see is carrousel of images from the film with a header on top of the image that says " Instead, together we Distant Socialize". The image carrousels are activated with java script. I used java script to have three different images played in a caroussel with 3 seconds interval. To prevent the potential miscommunication of visitors not knowing that this is a film website, I used black/dark gradients to conceptualize the cinematic experience. I used the black background colors for the Top navigation bar and the footer section. I have also reduced the brightness of the images on the carousel. This dark and dim tone of the page with moving images on the background, despite not having the actual film screening on the first page,it immediatly sets a cinematic tone and encourages visitors to think this website to be something related to film, and as they read the icons on the top navigation bar; Home, Film, Cast&Crew and Review, they can cofirm that it is a film website. 
  
 By having the srcoll bar on the side and the white space underneath the carousel images, I indicated that there are more contents down below. As users scroll down, they reach the second section of the homepage, which is the film on the left with the control button, and the description of the film on its right. Originally, the thumbnail of the video file was pitch black image, but I have added the "poster" to this video, an image that has all the casts in. This is to show a glimpse of the film, before the visitors actually click and start watching the video. On the right handside, there is a description of the film; the title, the released date, a quote, and a short explanation of the motive of this film. The quote in the grey boxis written there to strenghten the message of the film. However, with no action, the sentence is incomplete, but as users hover the mouse on the grey box, the complete sentnece appears, which completes the quote and also impreses users with a powerful message.
 
When scroll down a little bit more, users are introduced with the three column boxes with visual descripton of different pages of this website, with a 'click' link button that encourages an action from the viewers. The column boxs are filled with a beautiful gradients of color, each with different colors, blue, red and yellow, which corresponds to the color of the website logo, that is found on the top-left of the page. I have created simple yet colorful and joyful logo with initial of the film title IDS using a photoshop. Such color imagery and repetition in the website, the logo and the colors of the column boxes maybe subtle and not readily noticed by the visitors, yet it helps in capturing the colorful and joyful tone of the website on the back of the users mind unconsciously. 

The contact section in the bottom, which can be also reached by clicking contact button on the top navigation bar, has multiple source of contacts. As visitors click the email button, it will directly open up their mail box with the receiptant wrtten on the page. Similarly, the social media icons are clickable, and it will direct users to the according webpage. This interaction is made to support the theme of "connection", allowing visitors to virtually connect with the creator of this website.

There is a couple of ways to reach other pages of the website. First way is by clicking icons on the top navigation box and another way is by clicking the "click" button on the column box section. Either way, by clicking icons, viewers will reach to another page. All the pages have top-navigation bar on top, so the users can always go back go homepage or different pages of the website, wherever they are. 

The film page is a page where visitors can view the full-length film. I have designed the page in a way that film is played automatically. I made it play automatic to grab visitors' attention with the backgorund music that plays along with the film as soon as they visits "film" page of this website. But I have added control webkit line so if that visitors control the film. With this control webkit, viewers can adjjust the volume of souund, move 15 seconds forward or backwards, as well as pause or re-start the film. Another interactivity that I embed on this page with a java-script is "Watch in full screen" action. On the top navigation bar, there is a gold button with a text "Full Screen". Once the viewer click this button, they will be able to watch the film in full screen. The java script is set to function set full screen mode of the assigned video, when the "full screen" button is clicked. 

The Cast&Crew page introduces the 4 casts and crews of the film. The page is structured with top navigation and four equal boxes of images(black and white) of the casts with their name. As the user hovers mouse on the image of a cast, that image will change to the circular color image of a cast with the general description of them. The description text includes the name,role, age, home, and their favourite quote. The hover image of casts are cropped into the circle shape to semiotically represent the feeling of "spotlight" on the stage in real life. 

The review page, like all the other pages also has a top navigation bar on top and the place where visitors can read others' reveiws and write their own reviews as well. On the left side of the page, there are reviews of other people. These reviews are  represented in a slideshow model, which users can click the arrow buttons on the side of the image to flip through the reviewers and read different reviewers' reviews. There are dots underneath the image to help them navitage through the reveiwers. On the right side, there is a review box, where viewers can type-in their own reviews. 

  Overall, through this project I had learned a lot on how encode my design on head to written script using html/css/javascript languages. Since I made the website from the scratch, for every step that I take, it took me a long time to learn how to communicate with the computer. The simple idea such as 'if the mouse hovers on certain button, the color will change' may be simple on head, but to actually make it happen on the digital based website, there were much more things that I had to take in consideration since computer only understand certain script languages. Once I leanrt how to do simple things like positioning texts in certain way, I tried to upgrade it by adding designs and interactivity to the content. live feedback. For my future project, I would like to learn how to add this element in the website.
  
  To conclude, I am very satisfied with my project because there are a lot of interactive elements in the website such as hover, ghost text, click, caroussel element and etcetera. Since each designs and event listner elemnts required a careful decision and consideration thinking from the user experience, so the process was like nurturing a children, starting from something small to develop it into a better project. Thanks to the wireframing, I was able to create 4 different pages that are unique in their own ways, but also has an overarching theme and they interact well with one another. 
  
  One thing that I would like to improve on is the comment submit box. I wanted it to be "live" interaction as in once the visitor fill out the comment box and "submit" their comment, it will appear on the website. In this way, the viewers can feel they are part of the community and have some sense of authorship as well. However, given the stage of my coding skill, I didn't know how to script it to have a live feedback. Another alternative would be have it submitted to my email box, so the website owner, myself can choose what reivews to be uploaded to control the quality of the content. 
  
  Another issue that on Chrome, the structure of "footer" area is distorted, while it works fine on Safari. When I was developing the website, I used safari as a reference browser, so I just found out this problem at the end of web-development. Since I want mywebsite to be an inclusive for al the users, whether they are using Chrome or Safari, I would like to learn how to develop a webpage that is coherent in all different browsers.
